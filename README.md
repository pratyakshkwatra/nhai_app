# NHAI Inspection Flutter App

> ⚡ Road Inspection. Reimagined. Real-time. Cloud-powered.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The **NHAI Inspection App** is the official frontend to our intelligent road inspection system, powered by a cloud backend (AWS hosted ([`nhai_backend`](https://github.com/pratyakshkwatra/nhai_backend)) ) and the OCR enabled ([`nhai_middleware`](https://github.com/pratyakshkwatra/nhai_middleware))  fusion engine.

Originally designed as a local only inspection tool, the app has evolved into a robust multi - user platform that connects **Admins** and **Inspection Officers** to survey data, video feeds, and real-time alerts — all through a central server.

The app enables seamless:
* **Survey uploads (video + sensor excel)**
* **Data fusion using our OCR engine**
* **Cloud-based processing and sharing**
* **Inspector access control**
